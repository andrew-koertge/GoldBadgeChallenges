# ElevenFifty Academy Gold Badge Challenges
### This is my submission for my 3 Gold Badge challenges
The following challenges were all completed using C# and include unit tests

# My thoughts about this challenge
I had my fair share of struggles and difficulties along the way. I'd like to detail some of them below:
1. Having to learn about queues and how to implement them
2. Trying to juggle different data structures and figuring out how to use them properly
3. Unit testing was a real struggle, they never felt right and always seemed like they served no real purpose
4. Attempting to figure out how to keep code clean while still being functional presented challenges

# Things I would change going forward
- Give myself more time
  -  This is the worst one for me. I would panic about the deadline and lose focus trying to get everything done at once
  -  I need to calm my nerves more and focus on the task at hand.
- Stop worrying about the little things and make sure the core is there
  -  I would routinely get too involved in some tiny detail and I didn't get the big stuff done
  -  I spent too much time jumping around from challenge to challenge thinking it would help and it just caused more panic
- Ask more questions
  -  I needed to open up more about these problems I was experiencing but thought I could work through them myself.
